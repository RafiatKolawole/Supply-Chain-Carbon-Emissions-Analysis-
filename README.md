# Supply Chain Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across supply chains in multiple industries to identify key emission drivers and assess how business margins influence environmental impact.

The dashboard highlights emission-intensive activities and demonstrates how sustainability considerations extend beyond production into pricing and operational structures.

## Tools Used
- Power BI
- Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Data Modeling
- Data Visualization
- Sustainability & ESG Analysis

## Objectives
- Identify supply chain segments contributing most to GHG emissions
- Compare emission levels across industries
- Assess the impact of profit margins on total supply chain emissions
- Highlight industries with lower emissions as sustainability benchmarks

## Key Insights
- Solid waste management and cement manufacturing emerged as major emission hotspots
- Agricultural industries showed noticeable emission increases once margins were incorporated
- On average, profit margins contributed nearly **8%** of total supply chain emissions
- Several industries maintained low emission levels, demonstrating that sustainable supply chains are achievable

## Business & Environmental Impact
Understanding emission drivers enables organizations to prioritize sustainability initiatives more effectively—whether through operational efficiency, pricing strategies, or supply chain restructuring.

## Conclusion
This analysis reinforces that sustainability is not limited to production processes alone but spans the entire supply chain. Data-driven insights are essential for balancing profitability with environmental responsibility.
